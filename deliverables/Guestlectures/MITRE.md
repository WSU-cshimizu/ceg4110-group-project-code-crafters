## Pertinent Questions
* Question 1 - Are there any plans for MITRE to build a quantum computer?
* Question 2 - What skill that you have learned was the hardest to learn and be proficient with?

## Lessons Learned

* MITRE is a not for profit company
* Backwords working with test cases, write the test cases to conform to the software built
* With code, read 3 times, do 7 times. Do a couple tutorials, then practice making/breaking things
* Take notes about what will be learned each day even if its a small/fancy portion of any feature, to record personal growth.
* Dont orient to just the software development part but also reach out to devops too even if its a just the fundamendatals.

## Teaching Differences

* No one really know what agile means, it is all up to interpretation of a certain group

* We are not bound to any SE strategies so designs can and will change.
